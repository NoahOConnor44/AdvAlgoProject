## 1- Maximum-Weight-Independent Set in a graphic matroid
Please run the following command:
```bash
ruby 1-MWI-set.rb input.txt
```

When run on correct input, it should print out the max-independent set with maximum weight as follows:

```console
foo@bar:~$ ruby 1-MWI-set.rb input.txt
[["1", "2", "3", "0"], 2.5]
```
Here 2.5 is the max-weight of the path of nodes in sequence to they are printed
